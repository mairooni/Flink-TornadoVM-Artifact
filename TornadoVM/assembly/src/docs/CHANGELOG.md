        ```java
        WorkerGrid1D worker1D = new WorkerGrid1D(4096);
        ```
	- A `GridTask` is a map that relates a task-name with a worker-grid.  
       ```java
        GridTask gridTask = new GridTask();
        gridTask.set("s0.t0", worker1D);
       ```
	- A TornadoVM Task-Schedule can be executed using a `GridTask`:
      ```java
      ts.execute(gridTask);
      ```
	- More info: [link](https://github.com/beehive-lab/TornadoVM/commit/6191720fd947d3102e784dade9e576ed8af11068)
