# TornadoVM

<img align="right" width="250" height="250" src="etc/tornadoVM_Logo.jpg">

TornadoVM is a plug-in to OpenJDK and GraalVM that allows programmers to automatically run Java programs on
heterogeneous hardware. TornadoVM currently targets OpenCL-compatible devices and it runs on multi-core CPUs, dedicated
GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD), integrated GPUs (Intel HD Graphics and ARM Mali), and FPGAs (Intel and Xilinx).

**Website**: [tornadovm.org](https://www.tornadovm.org)

For a quick introduction please read the following [FAQ](assembly/src/docs/15_FAQ.md).

**Current Release:** TornadoVM 0.11 - 29/09/2021 : See [CHANGELOG](assembly/src/docs/CHANGELOG.md#tornadovm-0.11)

Previous Releases can be found [here](assembly/src/docs/Releases.md)

## 1. Installation

In Linux and Mac OSx, TornadoVM can be installed by the [installer](https://github.com/beehive-lab/tornadovm-installer).
Alternatively, TornadoVM can be installed either [from source](INSTALL.md) or 
by [using Docker](assembly/src/docs/13_INSTALL_WITH_DOCKER.md).

You can also run TornadoVM on Amazon AWS CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs following the
instructions [here](assembly/src/docs/17_AWS.md).

## 2. Usage Instructions

TornadoVM is currently being used to accelerate machine learning and deep learning applications, computer vision,
physics simulations, financial applications, computational photography, and signal processing.

We have a use-case, [kfusion-tornadovm](https://github.com/beehive-lab/kfusion-tornadovm), for accelerating a
computer-vision application implemented in Java using the Tornado-API to run on GPUs.

We also have a set
of [examples](https://github.com/beehive-lab/TornadoVM/tree/master/examples/src/main/java/uk/ac/manchester/tornado/examples)
that includes NBody, DFT, KMeans computation and matrix computations.

## 3. Programming Model

TornadoVM exposes to the programmer task-level, data-level and pipeline-level parallelism via a light Application
Programming Interface (API). In addition, TornadoVM uses single-source property, in which the code to be accelerated and
the host code live in the same Java program.

Compute-kernels in TornadoVM can be programmed using two different approaches:

#### a) Loop-parallelism

Compute kernels are written in a sequential form (tasks programmed for a single thread execution). To express
parallelism, TornadoVM exposes two annotations that can be used in loops and parameters: a) `@Parallel` for annotating
parallel loops; and b) `@Reduce` for annotating parameters used in reductions.

The following code snippet shows a full example to accelerate Matrix-Multiplication using TornadoVM and the
loop-parallel API:

```java
public class Compute {
    private static void mxmLoop(Matrix2DFloat A, Matrix2DFloat B, Matrix2DFloat C, final int size) {
        for (@Parallel int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            for (@Parallel int j = 0; j < size; j++) {
                float sum = 0.0f;
                for (int k = 0; k < size; k++) {
                    sum += A.get(i, k) * B.get(k, j);
                }
                C.set(i, j, sum);
            }
        }
    }

    public void run(Matrix2DFloat A, Matrix2DFloat B, Matrix2DFloat C, final int size) {
        TaskSchedule ts = new TaskSchedule("s0")
                .streamIn(A, B)                               // Stream data from host to device
                .task("t0", Compute::mxmLoop, A, B, C, size)  // Each task points to an existing Java method
                .streamOut(C);                                // sync arrays with the host side
        ts.execute();   // It will execute the code on the default device (e.g. a GPU)
    }
}
```

#### b) Kernel Parallelism

Another way to express compute-kernels in TornadoVM is via the kernel-parallel API. To do so, TornadoVM exposes
a `KernelContext` with which the application can directly access the thread-id, allocate memory in local memory
(shared memory on NVIDIA devices), and insert barriers. This model is similar to programming compute-kernels in OpenCL
and CUDA. Therefore, this API is more suitable for GPU/FPGA expert programmers that want more control or want to port
existing CUDA/OpenCL compute kernels into TornadoVM.

The following code-snippet shows the Matrix Multiplication example using the kernel-parallel API:

```java
public class Compute {
    private static void mxmKernel(KernelContext context, Matrix2DFloat A, Matrix2DFloat B, Matrix2DFloat C, final int size) {
        int idx = context.threadIdx;
        int jdx = context.threadIdy;
        float sum = 0;
        for (int k = 0; k < size; k++) {
            sum += A.get(idx, k) * B.get(k, jdx);
        }
        C.set(idx, jdx, sum);
    }

    public void run(Matrix2DFloat A, Matrix2DFloat B, Matrix2DFloat C, final int size) {
        // When using the kernel-parallel API, we need to create a Grid and a Worker

        WorkerGrid workerGrid = new WorkerGrid2D(size, size);    // Create a 2D Worker
        GridScheduler gridScheduler = new GridScheduler("s0.t0", workerGrid);  // Attach the worker to the Grid
        KernelContext context = new KernelContext();             // Create a context
        workerGrid.setLocalWork(32, 32, 1);                      // Set the local-group size

        TaskSchedule ts = new TaskSchedule("s0")
                .streamIn(A, B)                                 // Stream data from host to device
                .task("t0", Compute::mxmKernel, context, A, B, C, size)  // Each task points to an existing Java method
                .streamOut(C);                                  // sync arrays with the host side
        ts.execute(gridScheduler);   // Execute with a GridScheduler
    }
}
```

Additionally, the two modes of expressing parallelism (kernel and loop parallelization) can be combined in the same
task-schedule object.

## 4. Dynamic Reconfiguration

Dynamic reconfiguration is the ability of TornadoVM to perform live task migration between devices, which means that
TornadoVM decides where to execute the code to increase performance (if possible). In other words, TornadoVM switches
devices if it can detect that a specific device can yield better performance (compared to another). With the
task-migration, the TornadoVM's approach is to only switch device if it detects an application can be executed faster
than the CPU execution using the code compiled by C2 or Graal-JIT, otherwise it will stay on the CPU. So TornadoVM can
be seen as a complement to C2 and Graal. This is because there is no single hardware to best execute all workloads
efficiently. GPUs are very good at exploiting SIMD applications, and FPGAs are very good at exploiting pipeline
applications. If your applications follow those models, TornadoVM will likely select heterogeneous hardware. Otherwise,
it will stay on the CPU using the default compilers (C2 or Graal).

To use the dynamic reconfiguration, you can execute using TornadoVM policies. For example:

```java
// TornadoVM will execute the code in the best accelerator.
ts.execute(Policy.PERFORMANCE);
```

Further details and instructions on how to enable this feature can be found here.
